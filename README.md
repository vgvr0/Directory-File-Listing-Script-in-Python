# Directory-File-Listing-Script-in-Python

This Python script allows you to obtain a comprehensive list of all files within a specified directory. By providing the path to the directory, the script iterates through its contents and retrieves the names of all files present. It disregards subdirectories and focuses solely on files. The resulting list provides a convenient overview of the files contained within the directory, enabling easy access to their names for further processing or analysis.
